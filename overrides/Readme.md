# Overrides

This directory contains files with minor modifications to their originals in the [vitruv-tools](https://github.com/vitruv-tools) repositories. For each file, there exists a counterpart located at the same relative path as the file is located in this directory. To run the tests, the files from this repository need to replace the existing files to include the overriden functionality. In general, only smaller modifications are performed to the files which are not yet integrated in the main repositories.

The repositories are also added to this project as submodules.
