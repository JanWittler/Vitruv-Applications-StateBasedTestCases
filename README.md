# Evaluating Model Differencing for the Consistency Preservation of State-based Views

This repository serves as a replication package for the results discussed in the paper _Evaluating Model Differencing for the Consistency Preservation of State-based Views_.
The paper is published at the 19th European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA 2023).

Besides the evolution scenarios described in the paper (`AdvancedSuite`), there are further smaller test cases to check the model differencing against.
